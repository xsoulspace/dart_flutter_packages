Please write condensed plan for AI Agent, so he could execute it step by step.
Make sure that plan has ony onne final goal otherwise ask user what to do.

Make sure, that plan contains orginal links to sources, chosen configuration script, and written that way, so it would be possible to copy & paste in one click.

Always add as first steps:
1. Branch & Environment Setup
1.1 Create a new branch from the default branch (e.g., {name}).
1.2 Run the provided environment setup scripts to ensure Dart, FVM, and Flutter are correctly installed and configured.

- For flutter fvm (should be dependent from what user asks):
```
# Install Dart SDK (using apt, official Google repo)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https wget
wget -qO- https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://storage.googleapis.com/download.dartlang.org/linux/debian/dart_stable.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dart_stable.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dart

# Add Dart to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin"

# Install FVM globally
dart pub global activate fvm

# Add FVM to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"

# Install Flutter version from .fvmrc
fvm install

# Get Flutter dependencies
fvm flutter pub get
```
- For flutter without fvm:
```
# Install Dart SDK (using apt, official Google repo)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https wget
wget -qO- https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://storage.googleapis.com/download.dartlang.org/linux/debian/dart_stable.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dart_stable.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dart

# Add Dart to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin"

flutter pub get
```
