## 1. Analyze the Kotlin API

- Review the Kotlin API in `rustore-sdk-billing-example` and the official RuStore documentation.
- Identify all public classes, methods, callbacks, and data models that need to be exposed to Dart.
- Pay special attention to:
  - Initialization (`RuStoreBillingClientFactory.create`)
  - Deeplink handling
  - Product retrieval
  - Purchase flow (start, confirm, cancel)
  - Purchase info/list retrieval
  - Error handling and event logging

---

## 2. Plan the Dart Package Structure

- Create a new package in `pkgs/`, e.g., `rustore_billing_api`.
- Structure:
  - `lib/`
    - `src/`
      - `rustore_api.dart` (public Dart API)
      - `rustore_api.g.dart` (generated by pigeon)
      - `models/` (Dart data models)
      - `platform/` (platform channel implementations)
  - `pigeons/`
    - `rustore_api.dart` (pigeon interface definitions)
  - `android/`
    - Kotlin implementation
  - `test/`
    - Dart unit tests
  - `example/`
    - Example Flutter app

---

## 3. Define Pigeon Interfaces

- In `pigeons/rustore_api.dart`, define all methods, callbacks, and data models using pigeon’s syntax.
- Ensure all Kotlin types are mapped to Dart-friendly equivalents.
- Include error/result types for robust error handling.

---

## 4. Implement Platform Code (Android)

- In `android/`, implement the Kotlin side of the platform channel.
- Mirror the RuStore SDK API as closely as possible.
- Handle all method calls, callbacks, and data serialization/deserialization.
- Ensure correct lifecycle and deeplink handling.

---

## 5. Implement Dart API

- In `lib/src/rustore_api.dart`, provide a Dart-friendly API that wraps the generated pigeon code.
- Expose idiomatic Dart methods, streams, and error handling.
- Map pigeon-generated models to Dart models if needed.

---

## 6. Testing

- Write unit tests for the Dart API.
- Provide an example Flutter app in `example/` to demonstrate usage and test integration.

---

## 7. Documentation

- Document all public APIs.
- Provide setup and usage instructions in a `README.md`.

---

## 8. Continuous Integration

- Add CI for formatting, analysis, and tests.

---

### Key Considerations

- **API Parity:** Ensure the Dart API fully reflects the Kotlin API, including all features and error codes.
- **Deeplink Handling:** Document and implement the necessary AndroidManifest changes and activity overrides.
- **Event Logging:** Expose logging options to Dart.
- **Versioning:** Track RuStore SDK versions and update the wrapper as needed.

---

### Next Steps

1. Create the package skeleton in `pkgs/rustore_billing_api/`.
2. Start with the pigeon interface definitions for the main billing client methods and models.
3. Implement the Kotlin platform code for the most critical methods (init, product retrieval, purchase).
4. Build out the Dart API and test with a simple example.

---

**Summary:**  
You’ll create a new Dart package in `pkgs/`, define the API with pigeon, implement the Kotlin side, and expose a Dart API that mirrors the RuStore SDK. Start with the most critical billing methods and expand to full API coverage, ensuring robust error handling and documentation.
