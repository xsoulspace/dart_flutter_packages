/// A tool that a model can call to gather information at runtime or perform side effects.
///
/// Tool calling gives the model the ability to call your code to incorporate
/// up-to-date information like recent events and data from your app. A tool
/// includes a name and a description that the framework puts in the prompt to let
/// the model decide when and how often to call your tool.
///
/// A `Tool` defines a ``call(arguments:)`` method that takes arguments that conforms to
/// ``ConvertibleFromGeneratedContent``, and returns an output of any type that conforms to
/// ``PromptRepresentable``, allowing the model to understand and reason about in subsequent
/// interactions. Typically, ``Output`` is a `String` or any ``Generable`` types.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct FindContacts: Tool {
///     let name = "findContacts"
///     let description = "Finds a specific number of contacts"
///
///     @Generable
///     struct Arguments {
///         @Guide(description: "The number of contacts to get", .range(1...10))
///         let count: Int
///     }
///
///     func call(arguments: Arguments) async throws -> [String] {
///         var contacts: [CNContact] = []
///         // Fetch a number of contacts using the arguments.
///         let formattedContacts = contacts.map {
///             "\($0.givenName) \($0.familyName)"
///         }
///         return formattedContacts
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Tools must conform to <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swift/sendable>
/// so the framework can run them concurrently. If the model needs to pass the output
/// of one tool as the input to another, it executes back-to-back tool calls.
///
/// You control the life cycle of your tool, so you can track the state of it between
/// calls to the model. For example, you might store a list of database records that
/// you don't want to reuse between tool calls.
