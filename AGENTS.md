# AGENTS.md — Agent Entrypoint Map

Welcome. This project uses **Skill Steward** to make repository purpose, validation, docs, and agent handoff legible.

## Operational Desk

Run the following commands to interact with the project's agentic tools:

- **Show operational map**: `steward map`
- **Inspect Steward contract**: `steward doctor --json`
- **Validate workspace**: use the native validation command recorded in `steward.yaml`

## North Star Impact

Before durable structural changes, classify `north_star_impact`: `none`, `applies`, `clarifies`, `sub_star`, `amends`, or `conflicts`.

- `none` / `applies`: use the native workflow and validation gate.
- `clarifies`: update the smallest FAQ, docs map, skill, check, or validation message.
- `sub_star`: declare the local parent/child boundary and what the sub-North Star cannot override.
- `amends` / `conflicts`: stop and write or update an ADR before changing the repo center.

Ask whether the change serves real product pain, which North Star value path it serves, and whether a mechanism is becoming the mission.

## Claims and Evidence

Before claiming readiness, maturity, harness support, steward status, or adoption:

1. Name the exact claim.
2. Check the weakest proof that supports only that claim.
3. Route the durable artifact:
   - ADR for durable decisions and trade-offs.
   - FAQ/docs for standing why/how guidance.
   - Check/tool/test for repeated deterministic drift.
   - Current ledger for the weakest true current status.
   - Evidence for real proof or blocked proof.
   - Delete completed plans after extracting durable truth.
4. Record non-claims.

If the same friction loops twice, stop before making another packet. Name the pain signal, owner, native validation gate, smallest disposition, rerun route, and non-claims; then fix the owner, move repeated drift to a check/tool/skill/current ledger, leave the path native, or stop.

If this repo needs a current claim ledger, run `steward evidence init --minimal`.
Default to no harness: do not add actions, probes, benchmarks, or scenarios unless typed actions, probes, or benchmarks help real repo work.
Use `steward.yaml` and harness proof only when typed actions, probes, or benchmarks help real repo work.

## Harness product

The agentic harness (engine, host, workspace, AFM composition) lives in
`~/xs/ecsai_harness`. This monorepo keeps inference transports and the
shared contract packages. It does not route package maintenance through
the harness. See [ADR 0036](docs/decisions/0036_harness_product_relocated.md).

## Package Working Agreements

- `pkgs/xsoulspace_inference_core`: [AGENTS.md](pkgs/xsoulspace_inference_core/AGENTS.md)
- `pkgs/xsoulspace_inference_apple_foundation`: [AGENTS.md](pkgs/xsoulspace_inference_apple_foundation/AGENTS.md)
- `pkgs/xsoulspace_inference_mlx_native`: [AGENTS.md](pkgs/xsoulspace_inference_mlx_native/AGENTS.md) — the MLX-native engine host (ADR 0057/0058)
- `pkgs/xsoulspace_inference_laya`: [AGENTS.md](pkgs/xsoulspace_inference_laya/AGENTS.md) — the laya decision product (engine lives in mlx_native)

## Active Skills

Skills are installed locally under `.agents/skills/`. You can view them using:

- `steward list`

# Codemap — navigate this repo

Discover once per session: `resources/read` `codemap://surface/v1`, or `map_surface`.
Then call `map_index` with `operation=`. The transport refuses retired names
(`map_index_search`, `map_index_query`, `map_index_build`, and the other `map_index_*` tools).

Pass `"root": "/Users/antonio/xs/storage_problem/dart_flutter_packages"` when the client cwd is not this repo.

1. **Start** — `map_doctor`, then `map_index` `{"operation":"build","root":"/Users/antonio/xs/storage_problem/dart_flutter_packages","ignore_prefixes":["build/","dist/",".dart_tool/","target/"]}`, then `map_index` `{"operation":"context_map","root":"/Users/antonio/xs/storage_problem/dart_flutter_packages","limit":24}`.
2. **Find** — `operation=search` and `query`. Concept-shaped queries add `"mode":"bm25"`.
3. **Before an edit** — `operation=query`, `kind=impact`, `symbol` = `rel/path.ext::unit.name` from search. `kind=context` returns the node and its edges. `kind=trace` also needs `target`.
4. **One evidence packet** — `operation=evidence` with `purpose` (`understand`, `impact`, or `trace`) and `budget_bytes`. Open the exact original with `operation=expand` and the handle in `meta.expansion`.
5. **Before commit** — `operation=changes`.
6. **On every answer** — read `freshness` and `meta.transport`. Ordinary reads refresh a stale index. `freshness_policy=refuse` starts no repair. Navigation facts are review leads; they do not authorize adoption.

CLI, from the codemap checkout — same names as the MCP tools:

`~/xs/codemap/dist/codemap-cli exec map_index --args '{"operation":"search","root":"/Users/antonio/xs/storage_problem/dart_flutter_packages","query":"<substr>"}'`

Parser edges only. Unresolved calls stay in the payload.
