# AGENTS.md — Agent Entrypoint Map

Welcome. This project uses **Skill Steward** to make repository purpose, validation, docs, and agent handoff legible.

## Operational Desk

Run the following commands to interact with the project's agentic tools:

- **Show operational map**: `steward map`
- **Inspect Steward contract**: `steward doctor --json`
- **Validate workspace**: use the native validation command recorded in `steward.yaml`

## North Star Impact

Before durable structural changes, classify `north_star_impact`: `none`, `applies`, `clarifies`, `sub_star`, `amends`, or `conflicts`.

- `none` / `applies`: use the native workflow and validation gate.
- `clarifies`: update the smallest FAQ, docs map, skill, check, or validation message.
- `sub_star`: declare the local parent/child boundary and what the sub-North Star cannot override.
- `amends` / `conflicts`: stop and write or update an ADR before changing the repo center.

Ask whether the change serves real product pain, which North Star value path it serves, and whether a mechanism is becoming the mission.

## Claims and Evidence

Before claiming readiness, maturity, harness support, steward status, or adoption:

1. Name the exact claim.
2. Check the weakest proof that supports only that claim.
3. Route the durable artifact:
   - ADR for durable decisions and trade-offs.
   - FAQ/docs for standing why/how guidance.
   - Check/tool/test for repeated deterministic drift.
   - Current ledger for the weakest true current status.
   - Evidence for real proof or blocked proof.
   - Delete completed plans after extracting durable truth.
4. Record non-claims.

If the same friction loops twice, stop before making another packet. Name the pain signal, owner, native validation gate, smallest disposition, rerun route, and non-claims; then fix the owner, move repeated drift to a check/tool/skill/current ledger, leave the path native, or stop.

If this repo needs a current claim ledger, run `steward evidence init --minimal`.
Default to no harness: do not add actions, probes, benchmarks, or scenarios unless typed actions, probes, or benchmarks help real repo work.
Use `steward.yaml` and harness proof only when typed actions, probes, or benchmarks help real repo work.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **dart_flutter_packages** (15455 symbols, 38096 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/dart_flutter_packages/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/dart_flutter_packages/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/dart_flutter_packages/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/dart_flutter_packages/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/dart_flutter_packages/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

> Claude Code users: A PostToolUse hook handles this automatically after `git commit` and `git merge`.
